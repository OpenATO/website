## Code
* [SSP Toolkit: Auto-generated System Security Plan](https://github.com/CivicActions/ssp-toolkit/)
   * Originally based on OpenControl, this toolkit - created in 2018 - has been forked to create the SSP documentation achieving seven ATOs for three Federal Agencies, one of which took just two weeks.
* [OSCAL Reusable Component Definitions Library](https://github.com/CivicActions/oscal-component-definitions)
   * This is an early example of reusable OSCAL components. Work to do includes:
      * Update from NIST SP 800-53 rev4 to rev5
	  * Present ODP defaults as a Profile
	  * Include plain language assessments
