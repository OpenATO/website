OpenATO is an [open project and community](open).

With Compliance as Code as a base, a library of reusble and locally configurable component definitions can be created. These are best shared as Open Source so that experts across multiple domains can review and enhance as vulnerabilities are discovered and mitigated and the threat landscape changes.
